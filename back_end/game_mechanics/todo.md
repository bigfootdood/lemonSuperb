# Game Mechanics To-Do

* Figure out a way to simulate elapsed time
  * could store login time in DB
* Decide how much time it should take for a pet to:
  * starve (Zach you should not have this power)
  * get sick
* Let front end and database know exactly how you will store the data

**Be sure to keep all of your code local to this folder (for now)**
